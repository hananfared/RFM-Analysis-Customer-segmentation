# RFM-Analysis-Customer-segmentation


where we will be exploring various techniques for customer segmentation and analysis, with a focus on the Brazilian payment brand, Elo. Specifically, we will be using Elo's transactional and promotional data to identify the most relevant opportunities for customers, by analyzing their loyalty behavior.

We will start with RFM analysis, a powerful technique for segmenting customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value of transactions. We will then explore a simple rule-based approach known as the "Business Analyst Way," which can help us identify key customer segments and their characteristics.

Next, we will use clustering algorithms to segment customers based on a range of features beyond just RFM, such as demographic information or purchase behavior. We will also explore principal component analysis (PCA) as a way to reduce the dimensionality of our data and identify the most relevant features for segmentation.

Finally, we will use frequent pattern mining to identify common patterns of purchasing behavior and uncover potential opportunities for targeted promotions or discounts.
